Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Prajwal. I'm a curious soul with a love for movies, series, [books](https://prajwalskaranth.notion.site/Prajwal-s-Bookshelves-cc1dd8bf5f0d49f2985edae525ab923c), and the thrill of trekking through uncharted paths. Whether I'm solving a Rubik's cube or diving deep into a math problem, I find joy in the little puzzles of life. Winters and springs bring me to life, especially in the hill stations where I originated, and where the crisp air and serene landscapes feel like home.

But donâ€™t get me wrongâ€”beaches have a special place in my heart too, offering a calm that contrasts beautifully with the rugged hills. I'm a big fan of the Batman trilogy, which probably explains my affinity for complex characters and intricate stories. I like to think of myself as a modern-day explorer, always ready to tumble down a rabbit hole of curiosity.

Music is my constant companion, whether itâ€™s the soothing strains of classical pieces or the raw energy of hip-hop. I embrace the extremes because they keep life interesting. Oh, and shoutout to ChatGPT for being my go-to digital buddyâ€”though, unlike the movie _Her_, we're just good friends. ðŸ˜‰

So, if youâ€™re into deep dives, quirky interests, and exploring the edges of what makes life fascinating, youâ€™re in the right place. Letâ€™s see where this journey takes us!
